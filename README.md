# Dictionary SR - dictsr

## Motivation

I was starting a new course in an unfamiliar subject area, one which was heavy on the jargon. In order to keep track of it I needed a dictionary to which I could add words as I leared them (rather than looking them up constantly in a full dictionary). This program is the result of that need.

## Implementation

The program uses an SQL database and the default SQLite module that comes with Python. The GUI is constructed using a Model-View-Controller architecture using Tkinter.

## Completion progress

**This is a work in progress.**

I have not written the interface for adding new words yet. Two sample words are hard coded.

Classes and naming conventions still need some cleaning.
